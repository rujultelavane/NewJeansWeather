The classic Weather App -- but make it New Jeans (a K-Pop group) themed!

My app features UI leaning more towards the aesthetic side, using color schemes as well as images.
The user enters a ZIP code of somewhere in the U.S., and using the OpenWeather API, and then depending on the current weather in that area, the app:
- displays the image of one of the members of New Jeans
- shows the forecast for the next few days in that area
- plays a certain New Jeans song depending on the weather

This is probably one of my favorite apps I've made in Android, I got it to be fully functional and I had a really great time making the UI look pretty ✨
